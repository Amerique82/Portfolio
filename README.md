# Portfolio

Code that solves problems, design that tells stories.

This repository houses a collection of web applications and interactive tools built with intention and care. From academic citation generators to security utilities, each project prioritises clarity in code and elegance in execution. These aren't just exercises in syntax—they're functional solutions wrapped in thoughtful interfaces, designed for real people solving real problems. Whether it's helping students format their bibliographies or analysing text patterns, the goal remains constant: build tools that work beautifully and look effortless.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an obsessive attention to detail.
