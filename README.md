Code that works • Design that clicks

I like using my creativity to build things that actually help people out. And yeah, I want what I make to have personality and be a bit fun—why should tools be boring? 

But mostly, I’m thinking about accessibility, especially for people with dyscalculia... That's my main thing 🫶 So, clean code, nice interfaces, nothing fancy, just things that work the way they should.

Made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, love and way too much coffee 🩷☕️
