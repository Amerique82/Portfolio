This repository documents my journey developing technical fluency in web development, Python, and SQL as part of my MSc in Web Development at the University of Roehampton. 

As a Web Designer transitioning into Product Management, I'm building the coding literacy required to bridge strategic thinking with technical execution. Here you'll find coursework, experimental projects, and practical applications that demonstrate my progression from design-focused delivery to technically-informed product decisions. 

Each project reflects real problem-solving rather than theoretical exercises – because the best learning happens when building things that matter.
